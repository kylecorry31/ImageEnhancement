# Stargazer

Create high resolution astrophotography with your smartphone.

## Requirements
* Java 8
* Windows or Linux

## Installation
Download the zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Stargazer/releases). Unzip this and run navigate to the bin folder. Execute the Stargazer.bat file if on Windows and the Stargazer file if on Linux. 

## Usage
To use this software, you must take many (~ 32 to 64) photos with a high ISO and slow shutter speed (use a tripod). Put them into a folder once taken.
Then take about the same amount of photos at the same settings with either black tape, black bag, cover, or other black surface over your camera and put them in their own folder.

Select the corresponding folders in the software.

If you would like to align the stars in the photo, enable the "Align stars" feature, and select the type of alignment. If using auto align, you will be able to select the type of filter used and adjust its settings to until it can only see the stars. 

Once clicking on the "Enhance image" button, the software will attempt to enhance the photos. If manual align is selected, the software will prompt you to outline a few star streaks and will then begin the alignment process.
