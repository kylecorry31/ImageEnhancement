# Image Enhancement

Use your camera/smartphone to take pictures with very little amounts of light. Be sure to use a tripod!

To use this software, you must take many (~ 32 to 64) photos with a high ISO and slow shutter speed. Put them into a folder once taken.
Then take about the same amount of photos at the same settings with either black tape or a black bag over your camera and put them in their own folder.

The software will then average all of your actual frames together and subtract the average of the black frames to get a much clearer and less noisy photo.

This project was inspired by this following blog post by Florian Kainz: https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/experimental-nighttime-photography-with.html
